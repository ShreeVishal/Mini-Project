# Mini-Project
A course pre-requisite before undertaking my final year project from Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR). I was assigned to develop an attendance taking management system that consists of a mobile, web and server module.

Modules implemented:
- Mobile Module -> Implements the QR code and OTP method for attendance taking.
- Web Module -> Platform for instructors and administrators to manage attendance records
- Server Module -> Database to store the attendance records and interact with the client module for data retrieval (implemented via Google Firebase)
